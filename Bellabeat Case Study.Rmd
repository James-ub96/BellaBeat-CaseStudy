## Goals and Objectives:

**Task:** analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices, using this apply insights to one of Bellabeat's product delivering clear business actions that can be taken.


1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

What is considered healthyjjjj
Sleep: ['Between 7 and 9 hours of sleep'](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep-the-foundation-for-healthy-habits/art-20270117) and ['fall asleep within 10-20 mins'](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/how-long-does-it-take-to-fall-asleep#when-to-see-a-doctor)

Physical Activity: ['30 minutes per day](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/healthy-lifestyle-5-keys-to-a-longer-life-2018070514186) or ['between 150 and 300 minutes per week'](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015128) with ['between 7500 - 10,000 steps per day'](https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a31788212/how-many-steps-should-you-walk-a-day/)





## Preparing our Data:

This case study uses data from the Kaggle data set ['Fitbit'](kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) complied by Möbius.
The dataset consists of fitness data generated between 12 April to 12 May 2016 by 33 Fitbit users. 

Possible issues with the data:
* Gender of Ids is not present
  + As Bellabeat is geared towards Women seeing trend difference between men and women would be useful.
* Age of Ids is not present
  + Know different trends between age groups would all for Bellabeat to target different age groups with different marketing strategies
  
Due to the similarities between the FitBit with the **Bellabeat Leaf** I have chosen to focus this case study on this product while also touching on the **Bellabeat membership**.

```
Our data is broken down into multiple spreadsheets encompassing *Daily*, *Hourly*, *Per Minute*, *Per Second*, as well as *Sleep* and *Weight Logs*

**Hourly:**

* dailyActivity_merged.csv
* dailyCalories_merged.csv
* dailyIntensities_merged.csv
* dailySteps_merged.csv
* sleepday_merged.csv

A quick look at these spreadsheets shows that *dailyActivity_merged.csv* is the combinded data of the other three hourly spreadsheets.As such only the *dailyActivity_merged.csv* speadsheet is needed.

**Hourly:**

* hourlyCalories_merged.csv
* hourlyIntensities_merged.csv
* hourlySteps_merged.csv

Unlike our hourly data doesn't have a pre-merged copy, as such we will merge the Data as such one of our first tasks shall be to merge these files.

This can be done with the following code in R:

```{r Merging Hourly Data}
hourlyActivity_merged <- hourlyCalories_merged %>%
  merge(hourlyIntensities_merged,by = c('Id','ActivityHour')) %>%
  merge(hourlySteps_merged,by = c('Id','ActivityHour'))

```
or the following SQL Query:
```{}
SELECT * AS hourlyActivity_merged_sql

FROM hourlyCalories_merged

FULL OUTER JOIN hourlyIntensities_merged ON hourlyCalories_merged.Id = hourlyIntensities_merged.Id AND hourlyCalories_merged.ActivityHour = hourlyIntensities_merged.ActivityHour

FULL OUTER JOIN hourlySteps_merged ON hourlyCalories_merged.Id = hourlySteps_merged.Id AND hourlyCalories_merged.ActivityHour = hourlySteps_merged.ActivityHour

```

**Per Minute:***

* minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv
* minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv
* minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv
* minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv
* minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv
* minuteSleep_merged.csv
* minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv
* minuteStepsWide_merged.csv


The *Per Minute* data is split into both a Narrow and Wide format, for this study we will use the Narrow format and ignore the Wide formats.
Again we will merge the Narrow data into one per minute table.

```{r Merging minute Data}
minuteActivity_merged <- minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged %>%
  merge(minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged,by = c('Id','ActivityMinute')) %>%
  merge(minuteStepsNarrow_merged,by = c('Id','ActivityMinute')) %>%
  merge(minuteMETsNarrow_merged,by = c('Id','ActivityMinute'))

```


**Per Second**

* heartrate_seconds_merged.csv

There is only one table which includes data by the second, the heart rate table.

**Misc**

* weightLogInfo_merged.csv

The weightLogIndo_merged table is a little different than the others. The weight log table is populated not by the device but by the user, as such this table can show us who uses a weight log feature and we can either push to grab more users using it or disregard it altogether.






This leaves us with only a few tables that we will spend our time looking at:

* dailyActivity_merged
* hourlyActivity_merged
* minuteActivity_merged
* sleepday_merged
* weightLogInfo_merged

We must now correct the format for the Datetime columns of our tables; these are all in tha character class format and should be in the datetime class instead.

```{r Datetime Format corrections}

dailyActivity_merged$ActivityDate=as.POSIXct(dailyActivity_merged$ActivityDate, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())

hourlyActivity_merged$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(hourlyActivity_merged$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())

minuteActivity_merged$ActivityMinute=as.POSIXct(minuteActivity_merged$ActivityMinute, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())

sleepDay_merged$SleepDay=as.POSIXct(sleepDay_merged$SleepDay, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())



```


Now we can start to look at this data.

## Analysis of Data:

First we will look at the completeness of our data. We know that the data was taken from 33 Ids; knowing this we can make the assumption that each table should have 33 unique Ids.

```{r Checking for Completeness, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
datasets <- c("dailyActivity","hourlyActivity","minuteActivity", "sleepDay", "secHeartrate","weightLog") 
distinctIds_tables <- c(n_distinct(dailyActivity_merged$Id),n_distinct(hourlyActivity_merged$Id),
                        n_distinct(minuteActivity_merged$Id),n_distinct(sleepDay_merged$Id),
                        n_distinct(heartrate_seconds_merged$Id),n_distinct(weightLogInfo_merged$Id))

completeness <- paste(round((distinctIds_tables/33)*100,2), "%")
```
```{r table, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
data.frame(datasets, distinctIds_tables, completeness)

```
```{r Output, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}

View(data.frame(datasets, distinctIds_tables, completeness))


a <- as.data.frame(table(sleepDay_merged$Id))
nrow(filter(a, Freq >= 16)) / nrow(a)

b <- as.data.frame(table(heartrate_seconds_merged$Id))
mean(b$Freq) /12 /60 /24

c <- as.data.frame(table(weightLogInfo_merged$Id))
nrow(filter(c,Freq > 5))

```



There are a few takeaways and questions that arise from this inital look:

* Activity Tables include the entire 100% of our users

* Only 72% of users used their device while sleeping
  + Of this 72% - only 54% used the for the majority of the month
  + Are users **removing** their device while they sleep?


* Only 42% of users used their device to measure Heart Rate
  + On average these users only used the Heart Rate Tracker 33% of the time
  + Are users turning off heart rate tracking manually or wearing device incorrectly?
  
* Only 24% of users used their device to track Weight
  + Of the 24% only 2 users used the log had more than five entries over the month
  + Users that only inputted their weight once or twice, are they forgetting? or not bothering after the first input?
  + How easy is it to access the log?



We now have an idea of how much our tables are being used; the activity and sleep tables provide information on the majority of our users. The Heart Rate and Weight tables don't even cover half of our users, though the data might not provide us with good unbiased generalized information we can look the lack of use as a point of interest.



# How Often do Users use their Fitbit?


```{r Time Wearing Fitbit}

user_hours_total <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  group_by(Id, ActivityDate) %>%
  summarize(TotalHours = sum(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes,
                               LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryMinutes))

user_hours_total$TotalHours <- user_hours_total$TotalHours/60


user_hours_mean <- user_hours_total %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(MeanHours = mean(TotalHours))


ggplot(user_hours_mean) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=MeanHours),color="black", fill="lightblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(user_hours_mean$MeanHours),linetype='dotted', color = "red", size=1.5) +
  annotate(geom = 'text', x = mean(user_hours_mean$MeanHours)-0.3, y = 4,color='Red', label = 'Mean Use',angle=90,size=6)+
  labs(x='Hours Wearing Fitbit',y='Number of Users',title='How Often Users Wear Their Fitbit') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
```


So we can see most users are wearing their Fitbits throughout most of the day with about half wearing them almost all day.
The people who are removing them we can take a guess and say they are removing it before they go to sleep as we know only ~70% are using it while sleeping.

# A Focus on What Makes People Healty

## Sleep:

```{r Sleep}
sleepDay_merged %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(MeanSleep = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep)/60) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Id,y=MeanSleep,label=Id))+geom_point(aes(color=Id)) +geom_text(aes(label=Id),hjust=-0.1, vjust=-0.1,size=2.1) +
  labs(x='Ids',y='Mean Hours Slept',title='Average Amount of Sleep For Users') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 7,linetype='dotted', color = "red", size=0.5) +
  annotate("text", x = 3500000000, y = 7.2, label = "Min Recomended Sleep",color='red',size=2.5) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))


a<- sleepDay_merged %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarise(MeanSleep = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep)/60) %>%
  filter(MeanSleep < 7)
print(nrow(a))

```

Of our users using their Fitbits while sleeping, only 13 users are getting more than the recommended 7 hours of sleep. A little under half of our users aren't sleeping enough! BellaBeat could prompt its users reminding them to get to sleep at specific times.


The following plot shows the difference between average time between spent in bed and time actually sleeping, on average it should take between 10~20 mins to fall asleep. From this we can see some of our users are having trouble falling asleep; BellaBeat could prompt such users with suggestions for sleep mediation or classes through the **BellaBeat Subscription App**

![Is it due to insomnia?](C:/Users/James/Documents/R Data Science/Insomnia.png)


```{r Plotting Sleep by Day}
sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek <- wday(as_date(as.POSIXct(sleepDay_merged$SleepDay, format="%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p")))

sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek = case_when(
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 1 ~ 'Sunday',
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 2 ~ 'Monday',
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 3 ~ 'Tuesday',
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 4 ~ 'Wednesday',
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 5 ~ 'Thursday',
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 6 ~ 'Friday',
  sleepDay_merged$DayofWeek == 7 ~ 'Saturday',
)


sleepDay_merged %>%
  group_by(DayofWeek) %>%
  summarise(MeanSleep = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep),TotalMinutesAsleep) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=DayofWeek,y=TotalMinutesAsleep,fill=DayofWeek)) + geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 420,linetype='dotted', color = "black", size=0.8) +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 500, label = "Max Sleep") +
  annotate("text", x = 1, y = 420, label = "Min Sleep")

```
We can see our users are sleeping the most on the weekend. This makes sense as most individuals will have the weekend off of work and won't need to wake up early, where during the week users aren't sleeping enough.

This could be users trying to fit in activities during the evening due to working during the day or because they are staying up late not accounting for having to wake up early. Ultimately BellaBeat could implement reminders about going to bed.



## Physical Activity:

```{r Adjusting hourlyActivity_merged Data Frame}
# Adding day of week to hourly table
hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek <- wday(as_date(hourlyActivity_merged$ActivityHour))
hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek = case_when(
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 1 ~ 'Sunday',
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 2 ~ 'Monday',
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 3 ~ 'Tuesday',
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 4 ~ 'Wednesday',
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 5 ~ 'Thursday',
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 6 ~ 'Friday',
  hourlyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 7 ~ 'Saturday',
)

hourlyActivity_merged$HourofDay <- hour(hourlyActivity_merged$ActivityHour)

# Adding day of week to Daily Table
dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek <- wday(as_date(dailyActivity_merged$ActivityDate))
dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek = case_when(
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 1 ~ 'Sunday',
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 2 ~ 'Monday',
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 3 ~ 'Tuesday',
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 4 ~ 'Wednesday',
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 5 ~ 'Thursday',
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 6 ~ 'Friday',
  dailyActivity_merged$DayofWeek == 7 ~ 'Saturday',
)


```


As previously mentioned the main tenants of a healthy lifestyle when it comes to physical activty were 30mins a day or 150-300mins a week of fairly active to very active activity and between 7500-10000 steps per day.

we'll take a look at step counts first:

```{r Steps Per Day over the Month}

StepsByDay <- dailyActivity_merged %>%
  group_by(ActivityDate,DayofWeek) %>%
  summarise(meanSteps = mean(TotalSteps))
ggplot(StepsByDay, aes(x=ActivityDate,y=meanSteps,fill=DayofWeek)) +geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+ 
  geom_rect(inherit.aes=FALSE,aes(xmin=min(StepsByDay$ActivityDate)-100000, xmax=max(StepsByDay$ActivityDate)+100000, ymin=7500, ymax=10000), alpha=0.01, fill="red") +
  annotate('text',x=median(StepsByDay$ActivityDate),y=9000,label='Recommended Steps',color='red')

StepsByDay %>%
  group_by(DayofWeek) %>%
  summarise(meanSteps2 = mean(meanSteps)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=DayofWeek,y=meanSteps2,fill=DayofWeek)) +geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+ ylim(0,10500)+
  annotate('text',x=median(StepsByDay$DayofWeek),y=9000,label='Recommended Steps',color='black') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 7500,linetype='dotted', color = "black", size=1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 10000,linetype='dotted', color = "black", size=1)
```


```{r Step Hours}

ggplot(data = hourlyActivity_merged, aes(x=HourofDay,y=StepTotal,color=c('red'))) + geom_point() +geom_smooth(color='blue')

StepsByHour <- hourlyActivity_merged %>%
  group_by(HourofDay,DayofWeek) %>%
  summarise(meanSteps = mean(StepTotal))


ggplot(data = StepsByHour, aes(x=HourofDay,y=meanSteps,color=DayofWeek)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~DayofWeek)+
  ylim(0,800)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 9,linetype='dotted', color = "black", size=0.4)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 17,linetype='dotted', color = "black", size=0.4)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 23,linetype='dotted', color = "red", size=0.4)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 7,linetype='dotted', color = "red", size=0.4)+
  labs(x='Hour of Day',y='Mean Steps',title='Average Steps per Weekday')

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
